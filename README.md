# L'Intello

*The brainy one* — a smart AI backend for multi-LLM routing, literary analysis, writing tools, OCR, and document reconstruction.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/collaed/lintello.git
cd intello
cp .env.example .env    # Add your API keys
docker compose up -d    # → http://localhost:8000
```

Get a free Groq key at https://console.groq.com — that's enough to start.

## What it does

### 🤖 Multi-LLM Routing
29 models across 13 providers. Ask a question → L'Intello picks the best free model, falls back on failure, caches responses, and learns from your feedback.

### 📚 Literary Analysis
Upload a novel (TXT/PDF/EPUB) → get chapter structure, character tracking (spaCy NER), pacing curves, narrative thread visualization, and AI-powered edit suggestions.

### ✍️ Writing Tools
Show-not-tell, 5-sense describe, tone shift, brainstorm, shrink ray, first draft generator, 3 AI beta readers in parallel.

### 🔄 Writing Workflow
Project briefs → adaptive next-step → horizontal (expand) / vertical (enrich) modes → word count tracking → resumable across sessions.

### 📄 OCR
Tesseract → OCR.space → Gemini Vision auto-escalation. Single images, PDFs, async jobs for large books. 9 languages.

### 🔗 Version Reconstruction
Upload 50+ scattered version files → detect cross-references → rebuild complete document → LLM-smooth transitions.

### 🔌 OpenAI-Compatible API
Drop-in replacement at `/v1/chat/completions`. Works with any OpenAI SDK client, Ollama, external clients.

## Stats

- **6,100+ lines** of Python
- **1,500+ lines** of HTML/JS
- **70+ API routes**
- **29 LLM providers** (20 free, 41,850 free requests/day)
- **36 automated tests** (whitebox + greybox + blackbox)

## Why open source?

L'Intello was built as a personal tool — a smart AI backend that routes prompts to the best free model, analyzes manuscripts, OCRs documents, and reconstructs scattered version files. It turned out to be useful enough to share.

Most AI tools lock you into one provider, charge per word, or trap your data. L'Intello does the opposite:

- **Bring your own keys** — use free tiers from 13 providers, pay nothing
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your server
- **No vendor lock-in** — swap providers by editing one file
- **No subscription** — 48,000+ free requests/day across 26 free models

It's not polished commercial software. It's a working tool built by a writer who got tired of paying $59/month for commercial AI writing tools when free LLMs are this good.
